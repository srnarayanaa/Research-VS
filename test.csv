0,0712.4057,on compression of cryptographic keys,cs.cr cs.ni,"any secured system can be modeled as a capability-based access control system in which each user is given a set of secret keys of the resources he is granted access to. in some large systems with resource-constrained devices, such as sensor networks and rfid systems, the design is sensitive to memory or key storage cost. with a goal to minimize the maximum users' key storage, key compression based on key linking, that is, deriving one key from another without compromising security, is studied. a lower bound on key storage needed for a general access structure with key derivation is derived. this bound demonstrates the theoretic limit of any systems which do not trade off security and can be treated as a negative result to provide ground for designs with security tradeoff. a concrete, provably secure key linking scheme based on pseudorandom functions is given. using the key linking framework, a number of key pre-distribution schemes in the literature are analyzed.",10.1016/j.tcs.2013.04.010,2007-12-25,2008-02-19,['aldar c-f. chan']
1,0810.0328,efficient defence against misbehaving tcp receiver dos attacks,cs.cr cs.ni,"the congestion control algorithm of tcp relies on correct feedback from the receiver to determine the rate at which packets should be sent into the network. hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of tcp acknowledgements) is essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and avoiding congestion collapse in the internet. however, the assumption that a tcp receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer holds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the protocol. in fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is to bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to conceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders arbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows, leading to denial of service to other internet users. we give the first formal treatment to this problem. we also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism to force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect acknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating tcp receivers would be identified. the idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender generates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could generate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender; the sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof would indicate a cheating receiver. the scheme is very efficient in the sense that the tcp sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the proofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. the scheme is based on an aggregate authenticator. in addition, the proposed solution can be applied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring correct feedback.",10.1016/j.comnet.2011.08.004,2008-10-01,2011-12-26,['aldar c-f. chan']

(2) a concatenation and re-organization (core) module provides a bottom-up pathway for feature fusion, which leads to the bi-directional fusion fp that can recover lost information from lower-layer feature maps. (3) the core feature is further purified to retain richer contextual information. such purification is performed with core in a few iterations in both top-down and bottom-up pathways. (4) the adding of a residual design to core leads to a new re-core module that enables easy training and integration with a wide range of (deeper or lighter) backbones. the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on uavdt17 and ms coco datasets.",,2020-12-03,2021-09-17,"['ping-yang chen', 'ming-ching chang', 'jun-wei hsieh', 'yong-sheng chen']"

(1) soft correspondence: we define a matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences' requirement. (2) geometric consistency: every point in the continuous correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. we formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. this generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images. additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based regularization by using a pretrained model. finally, we design a new neural network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view images by building affinity matrices. our method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3d reconstruction accuracy.",,2021-09-20,,"['zhixuan yu', 'haozheng yu', 'long sha', 'sujoy ganguly', 'hyun soo park']"

1964,2109.11519,wsgat: weighted and signed graph attention networks for link prediction,cs.si cs.lg physics.soc-ph,"graph neural networks (gnns) have been widely used to learn representations on graphs and tackle many real-world problems from a wide range of domains. in this paper we propose wsgat, an extension of the graph attention network (gat) layers, meant to address the lack of gnns that can handle graphs with signed and weighted links, which are ubiquitous, for instance, in trust and correlation networks. we first evaluate the performance of our proposal by comparing against gcnii in the weighed link prediction task, and against sgcn in the link sign prediction task. after that, we combine the two tasks and show their performance on predicting the signed weight of links, and their existence. our results on real-world networks show that models with wsgat layers outperform the ones with gcnii and sgcn layers, and that there is no loss in performance when signed weights are predicted.",,2021-09-21,,"['marco grassia', 'giuseppe mangioni']"

1966,2109.11526,marmot: a deep learning framework for constructing multimodal   representations for vision-and-language tasks,cs.cv cs.cl cs.cy cs.lg cs.mm,"political activity on social media presents a data-rich window into political behavior, but the vast amount of data means that almost all content analyses of social media require a data labeling step. however, most automated machine classification methods ignore the multimodality of posted content, focusing either on text or images. state-of-the-art vision-and-language models are unusable for most political science research: they require all observations to have both image and text and require computationally expensive pretraining. this paper proposes a novel vision-and-language framework called multimodal representations using modality translation (marmot). marmot presents two methodological contributions: it can construct representations for observations missing image or text, and it replaces the computationally expensive pretraining with modality translation. marmot outperforms an ensemble text-only classifier in 19 of 20 categories in multilabel classifications of tweets reporting election incidents during the 2016 u.s. general election. moreover, marmot shows significant improvements over the results of benchmark multimodal models on the hateful memes dataset, improving the best result set by visualbert in terms of accuracy from 0.6473 to 0.6760 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) from 0.7141 to 0.7530.",,2021-09-23,,"['patrick y. wu', 'walter r. mebane']"
