0,0712.4057,on compression of cryptographic keys,cs.cr cs.ni,"any secured system can be modeled as a capability-based access control system in which each user is given a set of secret keys of the resources he is granted access to. in some large systems with resource-constrained devices, such as sensor networks and rfid systems, the design is sensitive to memory or key storage cost. with a goal to minimize the maximum users' key storage, key compression based on key linking, that is, deriving one key from another without compromising security, is studied. a lower bound on key storage needed for a general access structure with key derivation is derived. this bound demonstrates the theoretic limit of any systems which do not trade off security and can be treated as a negative result to provide ground for designs with security tradeoff. a concrete, provably secure key linking scheme based on pseudorandom functions is given. using the key linking framework, a number of key pre-distribution schemes in the literature are analyzed.",10.1016/j.tcs.2013.04.010,2007-12-25,2008-02-19,['aldar c-f. chan']
1,0810.0328,efficient defence against misbehaving tcp receiver dos attacks,cs.cr cs.ni,"the congestion control algorithm of tcp relies on correct feedback from the receiver to determine the rate at which packets should be sent into the network. hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of tcp acknowledgements) is essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and avoiding congestion collapse in the internet. however, the assumption that a tcp receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer holds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the protocol. in fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is to bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to conceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders arbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows, leading to denial of service to other internet users. we give the first formal treatment to this problem. we also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism to force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect acknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating tcp receivers would be identified. the idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender generates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could generate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender; the sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof would indicate a cheating receiver. the scheme is very efficient in the sense that the tcp sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the proofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. the scheme is based on an aggregate authenticator. in addition, the proposed solution can be applied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring correct feedback.",10.1016/j.comnet.2011.08.004,2008-10-01,2011-12-26,['aldar c-f. chan']

(2) a concatenation and re-organization (core) module provides a bottom-up pathway for feature fusion, which leads to the bi-directional fusion fp that can recover lost information from lower-layer feature maps. (3) the core feature is further purified to retain richer contextual information. such purification is performed with core in a few iterations in both top-down and bottom-up pathways. (4) the adding of a residual design to core leads to a new re-core module that enables easy training and integration with a wide range of (deeper or lighter) backbones. the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on uavdt17 and ms coco datasets.",,2020-12-03,2021-09-17,"['ping-yang chen', 'ming-ching chang', 'jun-wei hsieh', 'yong-sheng chen']"

(step 1) propose the delta time spent in public places (delta-tspp) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each us county from 2019-2020.

(1) soft correspondence: we define a matchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other image's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences' requirement. (2) geometric consistency: every point in the continuous correspondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. we formulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of epipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the point-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. this generalization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint detection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images. additionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based regularization by using a pretrained model. finally, we design a new neural network architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the probabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view images by building affinity matrices. our method shows superior performance compared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in terms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3d reconstruction accuracy.",,2021-09-20,,"['zhixuan yu', 'haozheng yu', 'long sha', 'sujoy ganguly', 'hyun soo park']"
